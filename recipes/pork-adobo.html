        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pressure cooking the pork in the Instant Pot allows for incredible tenderness with lots of flavor. Serve with rice.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound boneless pork roast, cubed</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, sliced</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1/2 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tapioca starch</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) and select Saute function. Once hot, add oil and pork pieces. Cook until meat is browned, about 5 minutes. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Mix in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add water, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, salt, pepper, and bay leaf; mix to combine. Turn off Saute mode.</li>
            <li>Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 15 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
            <li>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes. Remove pork to a medium bowl and keep hot. Pour out half of the liquid and reserve.</li>
            <li>Turn on Saute mode again. Stir tapioca starch into remaining hot liquid in the pot to create a slurry. Cook until sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Add in reserved liquid if sauce is too thick, 2 tablespoons at a time, or until desired consistency is achieved.</li>
        </ol>
